# Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that calculates Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) to understand the long-term value each customer brings to a business. By analyzing CLTV, businesses can develop targeted marketing strategies, optimize customer retention efforts, and maximize profitability.

## Project Overview

The project is designed to estimate and analyze the lifetime value of customers. This analysis helps identify high-value customer segments and provides insights for developing retention and acquisition strategies tailored to these valuable customers.

### Objectives
- **Calculate CLTV**: Estimate customer lifetime value based on historical purchase data.
- **Segment Customers**: Identify high-value customer groups for targeted marketing.
- **Provide Insights**: Understand customer behaviors that drive high CLTV, enabling data-driven business strategies.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares data by handling missing values and transforming features relevant to CLTV calculations.
- **CLTV Calculation Models**: Implements models to calculate CLTV based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values or using advanced methods like Gamma-Gamma and BG/NBD models.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Segments customers based on CLTV scores, identifying high-value, at-risk, and other customer groups.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes CLTV distribution, RFM metrics, and customer segments for clear insights.
